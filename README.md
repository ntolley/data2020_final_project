# data2020_final_project
Code associated with DATA2020 Fall 2023 Final Project (Group 10) for the poster titled: "Uncovering the role of transient neural oscillations during movement". 

The analyses performed in this repository leverage the "Spectral Events Toolbox" which is a time-frequency based analysis used to extract transient increased in spectral power in a univariate time series. Spectral events were extracted from voltage recordings in the motor cortex of an NHP performing an instructed delay reach to grasp task. The statistical analyses were implented in R and characterize the relationship between spectral event features (taken from the neural data), and behavioral features (namely reaction time and reach time).
