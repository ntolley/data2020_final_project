# data2020_final_project
Code associated with DATA 2020 Fall 2023 Final Project (Group 10) with poster titled: "Uncovering the role of transient neural oscillations during movement." 

This repository employs the "Spectral Events Toolbox" for conducting analyses. This tool utilizes time-frequency based analysis techniques to identify transient increases in spectral power in a univariate time series. Specifically, spectral events were extracted from voltage recordings in the motor cortex of an NHP that performed an instructed delay reach to grasp task. The statistical analyses were implemented in R and aimed to characterize the relationship between spectral event features (derived from the neural data) and behavioral features (i.e. reaction time and reach time).
